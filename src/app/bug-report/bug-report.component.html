<div class="content">
  <p>Our test team have highlighted the following issues with the app:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The date pickers on the booking form allow dates to be chosen in the future</li>
    <li>The form validation on the booking form should trigger for any invalid controls upon clicking submit</li>
    <li>Text inputs on the booking form allow numeric input</li>


    <li>Some form validation issue</li>
    <li>Issue with data mapper - perhaps remove type safety</li>
    <li>Paginator and Sort not working</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please try to fix as many of the listed issues as you can. Feel free to refer to any docs or investigate the
    solution as you would if you were in a normal dev environment.</p>
  <p>The test team have also noted that the original developer hasn't written any unit tests for their code. If you
    would like to add any test coverage, please do.</p>
